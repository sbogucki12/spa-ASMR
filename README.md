# Spa: ASMR

## About

ASMR is an acronymn describing the "tingling" sensation that some people experience when they hear soft noises such as when being examined by a physician.  ASMR videos have become popular on youtube.  I personally use these videos to help me sleep.  This website will allow users to view videos from my favorite "ASMR Artists".
